            | Cyberbullying is one form of cyberaggression that is more restrictively defined as intentional aggression that is repeatedly carried out in an electronic context against a person who cannot easily defend him or herself. Thus, cyberbullying consists of three main features: (1) an act of aggression online; (2) an imbalance of power between the individuals involved; and (3) it is repeated over time. An imbalance of power can include posts against an individual who cannot easily defend him or herself and or can include several individuals negatively targeting one individual.
